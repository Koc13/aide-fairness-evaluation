The 5-fold cross-validation yielded an average accuracy of approximately 0.766, indicating reasonable predictive performance. However, the demographic parity difference across racial groups remains relatively high at about 0.439, suggesting that the model's positive prediction rates differ substantially between races despite the threshold adjustment strategy. This reflects a trade-off between accuracy and fairness in the current approach.","metric":{"value":0.7661,"maximize":true},"is_buggy":false},{"code":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nimport lightgbm as lgb\n\n# Load data\ntrain = pd.read_csv(\"./input/train.csv\")\ntest = pd.read_csv(\"./input/test.csv\")\n\n# Features and target\nfeatures = [\"AGEP\", \"COW\", \"MAR\", \"OCCP\", \"POBP\", \"RELP\", \"SCHL\", \"SEX\", \"WKHP\"]\nX = train[features]\ny = train[\"PINCP\"].astype(int)\nrace = train[\"RAC1P\"].astype(int)\nX_test = test[features]\nrace_test = test[\"RAC1P\"].astype(int)\n\n# Prepare CV\nskf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)\n\n# Define hyperparameter grid\nparam_grid = [\n    {\"n_estimators\": n, \"num_leaves\": nl, \"learning_rate\": lr, \"max_depth\": md}\n    for n in [100, 200]\n    for nl in [31, 63]\n    for lr in [0.05, 0.1]\n    for md in [-1, 7]\n]\n\nbest_acc = 0\nbest_dp = None\nbest_params = None\n\n# Grid search\nfor params in param_grid:\n    accs, dp_diffs = [], []\n    for tr_idx, val_idx in skf.split(X, y):\n        X_tr, X_val = X.iloc[tr_idx], X.iloc[val_idx]\n        y_tr, y_val = y.iloc[tr_idx], y.iloc[val_idx]\n        race_tr, race_val = race.iloc[tr_idx], race.iloc[val_idx]\n        clf = lgb.LGBMClassifier(random_state=42, **params)\n        clf.fit(X_tr, y_tr)\n        p_tr = clf.predict_proba(X_tr)[:, 1]\n        p_val = clf.predict_proba(X_val)[:, 1]\n        p_rate = y_tr.mean()\n        thresholds = {}\n        for r in np.unique(race_tr):\n            probs_r = p_tr[race_tr == r]\n            thresholds[r] = (\n                np.quantile(probs_r, 1 - p_rate) if len(probs_r) > 0 else 0.5\n            )\n        y_pred = np.array(\n            [1 if p_val[i] >= thresholds[r] else 0 for i, r in enumerate(race_val)]\n        )\n        accs.append(accuracy_score(y_val, y_pred))\n        rates = [\n            y_pred[race_val == r].mean()\n            for r in np.unique(race_val)\n            if (race_val == r).sum() > 0\n        ]\n        dp_diffs.append(max(rates) - min(rates))\n    mean_acc = np.mean(accs)\n    mean_dp = np.mean(dp_diffs)\n    if mean_acc > best_acc:\n        best_acc, best_dp, best_params = mean_acc, mean_dp, params\n\nprint(f\"Best params: {best_params}\")\nprint(f\"Best CV Accuracy: {best_acc:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Corresponding DP Difference: {best_dp:.4f}\")\n\n# Retrain on full data with best params\nclf_full = lgb.LGBMClassifier(random_state=42, **best_params)\nclf_full.fit(X, y)\np_full = clf_full.predict_proba(X)[:, 1]\np_rate_full = y.mean()\nthresholds_full = {}\nfor r in np.unique(race):\n    probs_r = p_full[race == r]\n    thresholds_full[r] = (\n        np.quantile(probs_r, 1 - p_rate_full) if len(probs_r) > 0 else 0.5\n    )\n\n# Predict on test\np_test = clf_full.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]\ny_test_pred = np.array(\n    [1 if p_test[i] >= thresholds_full[r] else 0 for i, r in enumerate(race_test)]\n)\nsubmission = pd.DataFrame({\"id\": test.index, \"PINCP\": y_test_pred})\nsubmission.to_csv(\"./working/submission.csv\", index=False)\n","plan":"I propose adding a simple hyperparameter grid search over key LightGBM parameters (num_leaves, learning_rate, max_depth, n_estimators) using our 5-fold CV with group\u2010specific thresholding to select the best configuration by accuracy.

The best hyperparameters found were n_estimators=100, num_leaves=63, learning_rate=0.1, and max_depth=7, resulting in a best cross-validation accuracy of approximately 0.8068. The corresponding demographic parity difference was about 0.4572, indicating that while accuracy is reasonably high, there remains a notable disparity in prediction rates across racial groups. The warnings about categorical features with many bins are typical for LightGBM and do not indicate failure.","metric":{"value":0.8068,"maximize":true},"is_buggy":false},{"code":"import sys\nimport subprocess\n\n# install fairlearn if not already installed\nsubprocess.check_call([sys.executable, \"-m\", \"pip\", \"install\", \"fairlearn\"])\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nimport lightgbm as lgb\nfrom fairlearn.postprocessing import ThresholdOptimizer\n\n# Load data\ntrain = pd.read_csv(\"./input/train.csv\")\ntest = pd.read_csv(\"./input/test.csv\")\n\n# Features and target\nfeatures = [\"AGEP\", \"COW\", \"MAR\", \"OCCP\", \"POBP\", \"RELP\", \"SCHL\", \"SEX\", \"WKHP\"]\nX = train[features]\ny = train[\"PINCP\"].astype(int)\nrace = train[\"RAC1P\"].astype(int)\nX_test = test[features]\nrace_test = test[\"RAC1P\"].astype(int)\n\n# Prepare CV\nskf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)\n\n# Define hyperparameter grid\nparam_grid = [\n    {\"n_estimators\": n, \"num_leaves\": nl, \"learning_rate\": lr, \"max_depth\": md}\n    for n in [100, 200]\n    for nl in [31, 63]\n    for lr in [0.05, 0.1]\n    for md in [-1, 7]\n]\n\nbest_acc = 0\nbest_dp = None\nbest_params = None\n\n# Grid search with ThresholdOptimizer post-processing\nfor params in param_grid:\n    accs, dp_diffs = [], []\n    for tr_idx, val_idx in skf.split(X, y):\n        X_tr, X_val = X.iloc[tr_idx], X.iloc[val_idx]\n        y_tr, y_val = y.iloc[tr_idx], y.iloc[val_idx]\n        race_tr, race_val = race.iloc[tr_idx], race.iloc[val_idx]\n        # Train base model\n        clf = lgb.LGBMClassifier(random_state=42, **params)\n        clf.fit(X_tr, y_tr)\n        # Fairlearn threshold optimizer\n        post = ThresholdOptimizer(\n            estimator=clf,\n            constraints=\"demographic_parity\",\n            predict_method=\"predict_proba\",\n            prefit=True,\n            grid_size=100,\n        )\n        post.fit(X_tr, y_tr, sensitive_features=race_tr)\n        # Predict on validation\n        y_pred = post.predict(X_val, sensitive_features=race_val)\n        # Metrics\n        accs.append(accuracy_score(y_val, y_pred))\n        rates = [\n            y_pred[race_val == r].mean()\n            for r in np.unique(race_val)\n            if (race_val == r).sum() > 0\n        ]\n        dp_diffs.append(max(rates) - min(rates))\n    mean_acc = np.mean(accs)\n    mean_dp = np.mean(dp_diffs)\n    if mean_acc > best_acc:\n        best_acc, best_dp, best_params = mean_acc, mean_dp, params\n\nprint(f\"Best params: {best_params}\")\nprint(f\"Best CV Accuracy: {best_acc:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Corresponding DP Difference: {best_dp:.4f}\")\n\n# Retrain on full data with best params and ThresholdOptimizer\nclf_full = lgb.LGBMClassifier(random_state=42, **best_params)\nclf_full.fit(X, y)\npost_full = ThresholdOptimizer(\n    estimator=clf_full,\n    constraints=\"demographic_parity\",\n    predict_method=\"predict_proba\",\n    prefit=True,\n    grid_size=100,\n)\npost_full.fit(X, y, sensitive_features=race)\n\n# Predict on test\ny_test_pred = post_full.predict(X_test, sensitive_features=race_test)\nsubmission = pd.DataFrame({\"id\": test.index, \"PINCP\": y_test_pred})\nsubmission.to_csv(\"./working/submission.csv\", index=False)\n","plan":"We replace manual quantile\u2010based thresholding with Fairlearn\u2019s ThresholdOptimizer to enforce demographic parity more directly.
